# /handoff — make the work resumable from a clean checkout

Goal: a fresh `git clone` plus a read of the project's durable docs is enough for the next session to
resume — **except artifacts a project keeps local by design** (gitignored checkpoints, pools, weights,
venvs; `.gitignore` is the source of truth). Nothing meant to be tracked may live only in this
conversation, the working tree, or a session-bound process. Close every gap you find — don't just report it.

## 1. Capture the session's substance (if any emerged)

Decisions and their rationale, findings/results, approaches tried and rejected, open questions — anything
from the discussion worth keeping that isn't already in the code — into the project's durable docs (DEVLOG
/ TODO / notes, whatever the project uses). The conversation is not durable: a decision or finding that
lives only in chat is lost. Skip if nothing substantive emerged or if it has already been recorded.

## 2. Record in-flight / async work

For running or pending work whose continuation depends on session-specific context — cluster jobs,
background processes, scheduled tasks, or remote work not otherwise discoverable — record in an
active durable doc its **ID**, the **exact command/config**, **where outputs land**, **how to retrieve
them**, and its **status**, so a reader can resume it without this conversation.

An open PR is already durable and discoverable remote state. Do not copy its number, URL, transient
status, or CI state into a plan, devlog, TODO, or completed/archive record merely because it is open;
report those details in the final reply. Add repository documentation only when the project already
maintains a PR tracker or when resumption requires non-obvious information that the PR and repository
do not contain. Keep such information in an active work record, not a completed or archived one.

## 3. Surface what is NOT durable

- remote/scratch artifacts not yet collected; local-only artifacts the next session must regenerate or
  fetch (say how);
- session-bound watchers / background tasks that die with this session (the underlying job keeps running —
  say how to re-attach by ID);
- auth / secrets / local state that won't carry over.

## 4. State the pickup point

If substantive work remains, state the pickup point in an active durable doc (e.g. the top DEVLOG
entry or a TODO file), not only your reply: where to resume, the next decision, and what unblocks it.

If the task is complete and only PR review, CI, or merge remains, do not create or edit repository
documentation just to restate that transient state. Report it in the final reply. Never add handoff
metadata solely for this purpose to a completed or archived plan, task, issue, or devlog.

## 5. Commit and push — the final gate

Do this last, so the docs you wrote in 1–4 land too. Commit and push everything from the handoff
scope that is meant to be tracked:

- Follow repository Git instructions. Inspect the diff, distinguish task-owned changes from
  unrelated user or agent work, stage intended files explicitly, and verify the staged diff before
  committing.
- Leave unrelated work untouched and unstaged. It may keep the repository dirty; report it rather
  than treating repository-wide cleanliness as a handoff requirement.
- Ensure every task-owned tracked change is committed. Fetch and compare `HEAD` with the branch's
  configured upstream, not a remote name such as `origin`. Push the task commits so the upstream
  contains them. If the branch has no configured upstream, set it to `origin/<branch>` when that
  matches the repository's existing convention (sibling branches pushed the same way, a single
  remote); ask only when the target is ambiguous — multiple remotes or a fork setup, no comparable
  branches, or a name that looks private/scratch.
- **Respect `.gitignore`** — don't commit the local-by-design artifacts above. If a file is a mid-edit, or
  you're unsure it should be tracked, surface it and confirm before committing.

## Report

What's durable (committed/pushed), what's in flight (with the retrieve command), where you recorded the
session's findings/decisions (if any), what isn't durable yet, and the one-line pickup point.

If substantive work remains, end with a fenced text block the user can paste verbatim as the next
session's first message: the pickup point, the orientation files to read first (the active devlog or
TODO, README, design notes — whatever a newcomer needs to orient), and any in-flight work to
re-attach to. Skip files loaded automatically such as CLAUDE.md and the files it pulls in (e.g.,
AGENTS.md).
